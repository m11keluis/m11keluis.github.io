<center> I am a 5th year PhD Candidate in the Marine Science and Technology Program at the University of Massachsuetts Boston. I study complex aquatic ecosystems with remote sensing platforms for improved ecosystem monitoring, forecasting, and decision-making. Inclusive educational and research environments that draw from <b>all walks and disciplines</b> are central to my vision for being responsible stewards of our planet. </center>
