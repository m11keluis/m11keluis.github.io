<center> I recently defended my PhD in Marine Science and Technology from the University of Massachusetts Boston and will be starting at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory as a NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) Fellow in September. I study complex aquatic ecosystems such as coastal and inland aquatic water bodies and coral reef systems from remote sensing platforms. I'm passionate about using remote sensing for improvingecosystem monitoring, forecasting, and decision-making. Inclusive educational and research environments that draw from <b>all walks and disciplines</b> are central to my vision for being responsible stewards of our planet. </center>
