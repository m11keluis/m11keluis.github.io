## Current Research Focus 

1. **Fusing of Heritage and Operational Ocean Color Sensors**: I am focusing on developing an algorithm scheme that links inherent optical property measurements across CZCS, SeaWiFS, MODIS-Aqua, MERIS, VIIRS SNPP & NOAA-20, Sentinel 2 & 3, and Landsat 8 observations.

2. **Water Quality Applications in Google Earth Engine**: I am integrating water clarity algorithms into Google Earth Engine to increase the accessibility of satellite water quality monitoring data.

## Previous Work

1. **Capturing Coastal Water Clarity with Landsat 8**: [This publication](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025326X19303571#f0025) compiles Secchi Disk Depth (Z<sub>SD</sub>) measurements from New England water quality organizations to validate Z<sub>SD</sub> derivations from Landsat 8. Example code based on this work can be [here](https://github.com/m11keluis/oceanoptics/tree/master/Matlab/Examples/virginiaCoast).
