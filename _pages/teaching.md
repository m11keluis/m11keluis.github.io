## Teaching

1. <b> The Urban Ocean </b>: In the Spring of 2019, I developed and taught a transdisciplinary, place-based seminar focused on immersing students in the history, culture, and science of Boston Harbor and its Islands. 

2. <b> Girls Who Code Club - Grove Hall Branch of the Boston Public Library </b>: Starting in the Spring of 2017, I volunteered to become a coding instructor because I wouldn't be a programmer without informal mentoring by women. 

## Service

1. **School for the Environment - Graduate Anti-Racism Task Force (SEGART)**: In the wake of George Floyd's murder and subsequent protests, [SEGART](https://sites.google.com/view/segart) was assembled to reduce racial prejudice and harm in the School for the Environment. I serve as the convener of this taskforce and the principal investigator of the Online Conversations for Equity, Action, and Networking (OCEAN) grant, a Woods Hole Sea Grant funded pilot project aimed at increasing the visibility and representation of Black, Indigneous, and People of Color working in marine environments
